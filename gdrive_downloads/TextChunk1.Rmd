This text can be edited live in google drive but all your collaborators.
With this script, you can use all the usual R Markdown syntax like this
using citations (here I will cite [@lowndes_our_2017]). You can use
other Rmd syntax like *italics*, **bold text**, and in this case a
number from r like `r constantvalue`. Here is a citation of a table
(Table \@ref(tab:table-basic)), and here is a citation of a figure
(Figure \@ref(tab:fig-basic)).
